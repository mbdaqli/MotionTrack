# Butterfly Wing Motion Tracker
(Dense Optical Flow with ROI Masking)
![Result](results/Butterflytracked.gif)



This project tracks and visualizes the motion of butterfly wings using dense optical flow (Farneback method).
It focuses exclusively on the butterfly area by applying a custom mask and filters out background noise like leaves and flowers.
All outputs (images and videos) are automatically saved inside Google Drive.

# Project Structure
Dense Optical Flow (Farneback) for pixel-wise motion tracking.

ROI Masking: Focus only on the butterfly region.

Motion Thresholding: Visualize only fast wing movements (ignoring slow background).

Video Output: Save the processed motion visualization as .mp4.

Google Drive Saving: Results are directly saved into Drive folders.

# How It Works
Mounts your Google Drive.

Loads input butterfly video.

Crops the video between 14s and 20s.

Computes dense optical flow on each frame.

Applies a region mask to restrict motion tracking to the butterfly.

Filters out low-speed or static motions.

Generates and saves a motion visualization video to Google Drive.

#Requirements
Python 3.x

OpenCV (opencv-python)

Google Colab (recommended) or a local machine with Google Drive access

Install required libraries:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install opencv-python
If using Google Colab, simply mount Google Drive (no extra installation needed).

# How to Run
Place your butterfly video inside Google Drive, for example:

swift
Copy
Edit
/MyDrive/Butterfly Motion Track/Butterflywing.mp4
Run the tracking script:

python
Copy
Edit
analyze_butterfly('/content/drive/MyDrive/Butterfly Motion Track/Butterflywing.mp4')
Outputs will be saved at:

swift
Copy
Edit
/MyDrive/ButterflyDenseTrackingResults/results_YYYY_MMDD/

# Example Result
Only butterfly wings moving are visualized.

Background and flowers are fully masked and hidden.

A clean .mp4 motion video is produced.

ðŸ“ˆ Future Ideas
Automatically detect butterflies with deep learning (YOLO, Mask R-CNN).

Improve masking with segmentation.

3D flow visualization.
